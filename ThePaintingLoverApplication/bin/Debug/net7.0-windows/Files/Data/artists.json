    "Biography": "Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian painter, draftsman, sculptor, architect, and engineer whose skill and intelligence, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. \nHe used his superb intellect, unusual powers of observation, and mastery of the art of drawing to study nature itself, a line of inquiry that allowed his dual pursuits of art and science to flourish. \nHe was also frequently consulted as a technical adviser in the fields of architecture, fortifications, and military matters, and he served as a hydraulic and mechanical engineer. As a painter, Leonardo completed six works in the 17 years in Milan. Leonardo surpassed the naturalistic techniques of Early Renaissance masters through his meticulous attention to detail and through the introduction of new methods. \nLeonardo worked and traveled throughout Italy for a number of employers. About 1503, Leonardo reportedly began work on the Mona Lisa. From 1513 to 1516, he worked in Rome, maintaining a workshop and undertaking a variety of projects for the Pope. He continued his studies of human anatomy and physiology, but the Pope forbade him from dissecting cadavers, limiting his progress.",

The striking color, emphatic brushwork, and contoured forms of his work powerfully influenced the current of Expressionism in modern art. \nVan Gogh is legendary for being mentally unstable, but his paintings are among the most famous and beloved of all time. Van Gogh’s technique of painting with flurries of thick brushstrokes made up of bright colors squeezed straight from the tube would inspire subsequent generations of artists. Van Gogh’s style was spontaneous and instinctive, for he worked with great speed and intensity, determined to capture an effect or a mood while it possessed him. \nVan Gogh said portraiture was his greatest interest. He created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889 that vary stylistically. ",

Michelangelo's poetic impulse, which had been expressed in his sculptures, paintings and architecture, began taking literary form in his later years. \nHis David (1501–04), commissioned for the cathedral of Florence, is still considered the prime example of the Renaissance ideal of perfect humanity. On the side, he produced several Madonnas for private patrons and his only universally accepted easel painting, The Holy Family. Attracted to ambitious sculptural projects, which he did not always complete, he reluctantly agreed to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (1508–12). \nEach of his works transcribes his desire to reject tradition. In his frescoes, so precise that they look like sculptures, the characters embody power and elegance. The influence of the Florentine genius is simply inestimable, as his work is so colossal.",

By limiting the amount of detail and using simple but dynamic contours, Rembrandt avoided distracting the viewer’s attention. He led the eye primarily to the face and the suggested movement of the figure. He was also exceptionally good at rendering human skin convincingly.",

Many of his paintings contain the same furnishings or motifs that inhabited his own private studio, and his models were often women that he knew or relatives of patrons.\n During the height of his career, in paintings depicting women reading or writing letters, playing musical instruments, or adorning themselves with jewelry, Vermeer sought ways to express a sense of inner harmony within everyday life, primarily in the confines of a private chamber. Vermeer’s carefully chosen objects are never placed randomly; their positions, proportions, colours, and textures work in concert with his figures. \n Although he drew his inspiration from his observations of everyday life in such mature work, Vermeer remained at his core a history painter, seeking to evoke abstract moral and philosophical ideas.",

He also painted the gardens and the countrysides surrounding the villa at Montmorency. His adoration of the present and its refined modernity, and fashion bordered on frivolousness. On the other hand, he rejected every form of picturesque realism. \n Watteau belonged to a period of reaction against the classicism of the preceding era, in which division of the arts and of the separation of styles had been strictly observed. An attempt was thus made to ennoble the genres previously considered inferior (farce, improvised comedy, the novel).",

In 1830 he painted Liberty Leading the People to commemorate the July Revolution that brought Louis-Philippe to the French throne.",

Monet’s painting was an utterly contemporary yet unprovocative representation of a group of fashionably dressed picnickers in the forest of Fontainebleau. \nMonet’s first success as an artist came when he was 15, with the sale of caricatures that were carefully observed and well drawn. Besides the cathedral, Monet painted several things repeatedly, trying to convey the sensation of a certain time of day on a landscape or a place. \nUnlike landscape artists of old Monet favored using light colors as a base for his painting instead of the traditional dark primers. Monet's personal Impressionist ability is said to have reached its peak with his Giverny-inspired series of paintings of Water Lilies.",

Critics were also offended by his innovative technique, which to most appeared unfinished. \n His art also had evident affinities with the poetry and drama of his day. Munch was a leader in the revolt against the naturalistic dictates of 19th-century academic painting and also went beyond the naturalism still inherent in Impressionism. His concentration on emotional essentials sometimes led to radical simplifications of form and an expressive, rather than descriptive, use of color. \n Munch was heir to the traditional mysticism and anxiety of northern European painting, which he re-created in a highly personal art of the archetypal and symbolic. His work continues to speak to the typically modern situation of the individual facing the uncertainty of a rapidly changing contemporary world.",

His earliest canvases are in the 17th-century Dutch manner favoured by the French Realists of the 1850s.\nIn Matisse’s mature painting style, the forms tend to be outlined in flowing, heavy contours and to have few interior details; the color is laid on in large, thin, luminous, carefully calculated patches; shadows are practically eliminated; and the depicted space is either extremely shallow or warped into a flatness. \nLike many of the painters and composers during the early 1920s, Matisse relaxed into a modernized sort of classicism. Also he had been interested in etching, drypoint, lithography, and allied printmaking techniques since his first years in Paris and had produced a number of occasional prints.",

For the rest of his life he continued to produce his enigmatic and illogical images in a readily identifiable style.

Like the painters of the Ashcan School, Hopper painted the commonplaces of urban life. But, unlike their loosely organized, vivacious paintings, his House by the Railroad (1925) and Room in Brooklyn (1932) show still, anonymous figures and stern geometric forms within snapshot-like compositions that create an inescapable sense of loneliness. Hopper’s mature style was already formed by the mid-1920s. \nHis subsequent development showed a constant refinement of his vision.",

The style is always figurative in the Frida Kahlo paintings. Frida painted her reality, the elements and composition are irrational, strange and magical. \nThe artist's favorite technique is undoubtedly the self-portrait. Kahlo painted 55 self-portraits out of a total of 143 paintings. Her autobiographical and narrative style is unique: all her paintings tell of her own life, her loves, her difficulties, her fears and her past.",

    "Biography": "Mary Cassatt was an American painter and printmaker who was part of the group of Impressionists working in and around Paris. She took as her subjects almost exclusively the intimate lives of contemporary women, especially in their roles as the caretakers of children. \nIn 1874 Cassatt chose Paris as her permanent residence and established her studio there. She shared with the Impressionists an interest in experiment and in using bright colors inspired by the out-of-doors. Cassatt painted mostly figures of friends or relatives and their children in the Impressionist style. \n Her modern woman is expertly rendered in the 1878 painting In the Loge, the first Impressionist work the artist exhibited in the United States. Many male artists depicted women in theater boxes as objects of display, but Cassatt's female protagonist plays a dynamic role engaged in the act of looking. Nonetheless, the male gaze prevails, as in the distance, a gray-haired theatergoer stares directly at her with his own binoculars.",

Her unique portrayal of strong and independent women in her artworks captivated the public and paved the way for future generations. \nUnlike many other women artists of the 17th century, she specialized in history painting rather than still life and portraiture.

Her subsequent depictions of recognizable subject matter were replete with abstract shapes, including ovals, hooked or V-shapes, and spirals.",
